# :man_dancing: Boogie :man_dancing:

A (not yet) complete implementation of the [Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie) grammar, with a parser and pretty printer.

This includes the asynchronous extensions introduced by CIVL.

As of this latest commit, there are 21 / 147 failing input files (compared against the boogie test suite).
